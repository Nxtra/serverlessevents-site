## About

Serverless Events contains a curated list of upcoming events. This can be large conferences, local meetups, podcasts, webinars and a whole bunch of other awesome serverless events. The important part is that the event is focused on serverless in one way or another and by that is helpful to the serverless community.

Unsure if your event should be in the list? If your event is beneficial for the serverless community it should probably be in the list.
